Nasqueron Discourse configuration
=================================

This folder is a configuration volume for the web container of the Nasqueron
Discourse instance.

When the web container is launched, an initialization script is executed to create symbolic links for the following files to their relevant locations:

    * discourse.conf → /var/www/discourse/config/
    * discourse.pill → /var/www/discourse/config/

If one of these files doesn't exist, the initialization script will create one with the default example files provided by the Discourse installation.

Template mechanism
------------------
To avoid to store credentials and allow a more flexible configuration, a quick
template mechanism has been provided.

Credentials are stored in our DevCentral Phabricator instance, in the
passphrase application.

For example:
- %%credentials.17.username%% is the K17 login stored on DevCentral
- %%credentials.17.password%% is the K17 password stored on DevCentral

Generate a configuration file from a template
----------------------------------------------

A script, genconfig, allows to read a file, specified as argument, substitute
the credentials, and output.

It could be in the future expanded to store in phlux other configuration values.

SSH requirements
----------------
As we don't install tools like arc and jq in Docker host servers, a service SSH
account has been created on a deployment server to allow to run a script to
actually get the credential.

The remote server has to be set in the SSH_SERVER environment variable. If not
specified, it's assumed to be localhost. That eases test, if your own SSH key
works to connect on your current account.

The SSH remote account is expected to have arc, jq, our getcredentials script
and be able to authenticate through a certificate to Phabricator. The script
account must belong to a group allowed to get access to the relevant
credentials.

For our Nasqueron instance, this is the case for the zemke-rhyne (Zemke-Rhyne)
account on Phabricator side, which belongs to the a specific deployment project,
Nasqueron Docker deployment squad (#NasqDDS). The shell account is configured
on our main development server, currently ysul.nasqueron.drake.

It's expected to connect through a configured SSH agent with a key allowing
access to such account, without requiring password or passphrase.

Generate discourse.conf
-----------------------
./genconfig discourse.conf.tmpl > discourse.conf

Make
----
To automate the process, we provide a Makefile.

Add credentials
----------------
1. Go to Phabricator Passphrase application
   http://devcentral.nasqueron.org/passphrase/
   
2. Create a credential, add it to the relevant group
   Nasqueron Docker deployment squad
   
3. Click on the Allow Conduit Access link

4. In relevant template files, add the credential expressions (see above)
